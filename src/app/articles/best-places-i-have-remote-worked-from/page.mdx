    'I’ve been a remote worker since 2017—back when explaining my job required clarifying, “No, I’m not a hacker, but yes, I can work from a beach.” While the world discovered pantless Zoom calls in 2020, I’d already logged two years of nomadic coding from Tokyo cafés, Thai co-working spaces, and even a hammock in Réunion.',

I've been remote working since 2017—long before the rest of the world figured out that pants could indeed be optional during Zoom calls. From exploring bustling Tokyo streets by day to midnight coding sessions, here’s my personal review of the best (and worst) places I’ve ever remote worked from, complete with timezone hacks, Wi-Fi insights, and life lessons learned the fun way.

## 🇯🇵 Japan — Remote Work Nirvana (GMT+9, France +7h)

<Image src={japan} width={1000} height={600} alt="" />

Three months in Japan changed my idea of remote work forever. My workday started around 4 PM local time, with dinner at 8 PM (perfectly aligned with French lunchtime). I wrapped up around midnight or 1 AM, just slightly later than my usual bedtime in France.

That schedule gave me full, uninterrupted days to explore temples, slurp ramen, and get lost in neon-lit backstreets. I stayed productive while making the most of my surroundings. Oh, and the 4G? Flawless — even in Okinawa.

**💡 Tips**  
- Japan introduced a **Digital Nomad Visa** in 2024 — up to 6 months.  
- Best coworking pick: **andwork Shibuya** in Tokyo.  
- Grab a **Pocket Wi-Fi** for seamless connectivity everywhere.

## 🇹🇭 Thailand — Cheap & Chill (GMT+7, France +5h)

<Image src={thailand} width={1000} height={600} alt="" />

Thailand offered a similar flow to Japan, just with cheaper smoothies and warmer smiles. With a 5-hour time difference, I'd work evenings and explore the rest of the day.

The internet wasn’t always top-notch (a few years ago), but it got the job done. From Chiang Mai cafés to Bangkok coworking spaces, the vibe was easygoing and the cost of living unbeatable.

**💡 Tips**  
- Check out the new **Digital Nomad Visa (DTV)** valid for up to 180 days per entry.  
- Top coworking: **Punspace** in Chiang Mai.  
- Always **hotspot from your phone** in rural areas just in case.

## 🇷🇪 Réunion — Morning Beaches, Evening Commits (GMT+4, France +2h/3h)

<Image src={reunion} width={1000} height={600} alt="" />

My day in Réunion started with a swim. Literally. I'd hit the beach, grab a fresh juice, then work from 11 AM to 8 PM. It was the healthiest I’ve felt while working full-time.

The 4G network is surprisingly solid — even in smaller towns like Le Tampon — and the time zone is super manageable for Europe.

**💡 Tips**  
- Great coworking/co-living option: **Coliver** (Saint Pierre).  
- Local SIM with **Orange Réunion** is reliable.  
- Rent a car — **public transport is limited**.

## 🇺🇸 Hawaii — Beautiful, but Brutal (GMT-10, France -12h)

<Image src={hawaii} width={1000} height={600} alt="" />

12-hour time difference with France. That’s all you need to know. I was working at night, sleeping during the day, and completely upside down. Fell asleep in meetings more than once.

Yes, it’s paradise. But also ridiculously expensive. If you're from Europe, go to Réunion instead — same tropical mood, better timezone.

**💡 Tips**  
- Only stay if your clients are **West Coast US-based**.  
- Use **Spectrum or Hawaiian Telcom** for stable internet.  
- Budget for everything — even your cereal costs more.

## 🇦🇪 Dubai — Reliable & Surprisingly Practical (GMT+4, France +2h/3h)

<Image src={dubai} width={1000} height={600} alt="" />

Dubai surprised me. 5G everywhere. Cafés designed for remote work. A coworking space in every tower. Work-life balance here means coding with skyline views.

Only hiccup? You’ll need a VPN for Teams or Google Meet. But that aside, it’s ultra-modern and incredibly efficient for remote life.

**💡 Tips**  
- Apply for the **Virtual Work Visa** (1 year, ~3.5k€/mo min income).  
- Use **Du** or **Etisalat** for mobile data.  
- Great coworking: **Astrolabs Dubai** (JLT).

## 🇭🇷 Croatia — Adriatic Digital Paradise (GMT+1/2, Same as France)

<Image src={croatia} width={1000} height={600} alt="" />

Waking up to the sound of Adriatic waves crashing against ancient walls became my daily routine in Split. Croatia's combination of insanely fast internet (70+ Mbps), affordable prices, and jaw-dropping coastline makes it a remote work dream.

With barely any time difference from France, I maintained my normal work hours while spending lunch breaks swimming in crystal clear waters. The country's incredible infrastructure for digital nomads means you're never the only laptop warrior in a café.

**💡 Tips**  
- Apply for the **Digital Nomad Residence Permit** (up to 1 year, renewable after 6 months outside).  
- Best spots: **Split** and **Dubrovnik** (but avoid high tourist season July-August).  
- Try **Smartspace** coworking in Split for affordable, comfortable workdays.  
- Remember: you **cannot legally work for Croatian companies** on this permit.

## 🇫🇷 Corsica — France's Hidden Remote Gem (GMT+1/2, Same as Mainland)

<Image src={corsica} width={1000} height={600} alt="" />

Corsica felt like cheating. All the benefits of working from France (same time zone, no visa hassle for EU citizens) but with Mediterranean island vibes and dramatically fewer tourists than other Med hotspots.

I split my time between Ajaccio and Bonifacio, finding surprisingly solid 4G coverage across most of the island. The ultimate luxury? Finishing work then immediately diving into some of Europe's most pristine waters. Digital nomading without leaving France's comforting bureaucratic embrace.

**💡 Tips**  
- Book accommodations **well in advance** for May-September, as options are limited.  
- **Rent a car** — public transport exists but is limited and you'll want to explore the mountain villages.  
- Check out **Cowork in Corsica** in Ajaccio for dedicated workspace.  
- Expect seasonal businesses — many cafés and restaurants close November-March.

## Final Thoughts

Every destination brought something unique — but also taught me a few hard lessons (especially Hawaii). My formula today:  
🕓 Favor time zones that let you work late.  
📶 Never compromise on connectivity.  
💰 Skip overpriced dreams and aim for value-packed places like Réunion or Thailand.

Remote work isn’t just freedom — it’s design.  
Design your schedule, your city, your lifestyle. And if that means working in shorts from a beach bar, well… pants remain optional.
